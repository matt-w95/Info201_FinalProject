# Info201_FinalProject
Our shiny project is interactive app where the user is able to compare the
the gender gap in Seattle and the United States. In the app, it allows the user
to look at the top 10 jobs where men makes more then woman or jobs where women
makes more then men. The app also allows the user to look at the general trends
or look at specific jobs to view the wage difference and gender ratio of
employees.
